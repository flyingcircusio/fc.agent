Changelog
=========

1.5.1 (2014-10-01)
------------------

- Ensure we do not block restarts of VMs when the directory is not up.

- Ensure we screen directory exceptions when generating Nagios contacts.

- Remove old, unused, and broken KVM entry points.

- Avoid duplicates when creating technical contacts. (#13629)

- Explain how to run tests in HACKING.txt.


1.5.0 (2014-09-13)
------------------

- Integate new fc.qemu package instead of instrumenting a complicated
  init script.

- Restart firewall in case of changed config files.


1.4.1 (2014-09-09)
------------------

- Let Nagios configure contacts for technical contacts of resource groups, too.


1.4.0 (2014-08-22)
------------------

- Clean outdated RBD snapshots (#13414).


1.3.6 (2014-08-21)
------------------

- Bugfix: the actual config file we pass to qemu is the shell-expanded one in
  /run/kvm.*.cfg. The last refactoring accidentally pointed it to the template
  in /etc/kvm/.


1.3.5 (2014-08-21)
------------------

* Do not try to inmigrate VMs that should be running and *are* running already.

* Adapt test setup to py.test after moving to separate repository and
  get all tests green.

* Extract computation of tmp and swap volumes from init script so we can test
  them and make them more robust for migration.
