Changelog
=========

1.3.7 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.3.6 (2014-08-21)
------------------

- Bugfix: the actual config file we pass to qemu is the shell-expanded one in
  /run/kvm.*.cfg. The last refactoring accidentally pointed it to the template
  in /etc/kvm/.


1.3.5 (2014-08-21)
------------------

* Do not try to inmigrate VMs that should be running and *are* running already.

* Adapt test setup to py.test after moving to separate repository and
  get all tests green.

* Extract computation of tmp and swap volumes from init script so we can test
  them and make them more robust for migration.
