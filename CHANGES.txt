1.3.5 (2014-08-21)
------------------

* Do not try to inmigrate VMs that should be running and *are* running already.

* Adapt test setup to py.test after moving to separate repository and
  get all tests green.

* Extract computation of tmp and swap volumes from init script so we can test
  them and make them more robust for migration.
